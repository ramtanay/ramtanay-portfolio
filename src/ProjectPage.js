    name: " Real-Time Face Recognition System Using DeepFace and OpenCV",
    description: `A real-time face recognition system that leverages OpenCV for live webcam input and DeepFace‚Äôs ArcFace model for highly accurate face matching. This project detects faces from live video feed, compares them against a local dataset (LFW format), and highlights recognized faces with names in real-time. It also handles unknown faces gracefully and uses efficient error handling, dynamic confidence thresholds, and clean UI overlays.

Key Features:

Real-time face detection using Haar cascades.

Face recognition with DeepFace‚Äôs ArcFace model.

Dynamic name labeling and bounding box color codes (green for recognized, red for unknown).

Dataset-driven recognition (LFW-style folders).

Clean exit handling and logging for debugging.

Easily extendable with GPU support or embedding optimization.

Tech Stack:

Python, OpenCV, DeepFace, TensorFlow`,
